# SOLID 
***SOLID principles are some of the oldest rules in the software world. They enable us to write maintainable, readable, reusable code.***

### SOLID refers to :
### 1. S : _Single Responsibility_
**Each class should have only one sole purpose, and not be filled with excessive functionality.**

### 2.  O : _Open Close Principle_
**Classes should be open for extension, closed for modification. In other words class shouldn't be rewritten every time if any modification needs. Class should be extended for modification**

### 3.  L : _Liskov-Substitution Principle_
**A sub-class should be able to fulfill each feature of its parent class and could be treated as its parent class.**

### 4.  I : _Interface Segregation_
